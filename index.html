    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 1</h2>
    <p>In week 1, my teacher introduced me to html which i found really cool. the first thing 
        i actually grasped was adding a picture to my website so i added a picture of my favourite
    character on the website in replit. I also made a food recipe</p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 2</h2>
    <p>In week 2 i was introduced to css which was really beneficical to edit my website and also
        add cool designs to my website. Other than that i learned html semantics which helped organize my
        html and made it look neater
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 3</h2>
    <p>In week 3 i learnt positioning. This was extremely useful as it helped me position my pictures
        exactly where i wanted to and also made my website look way neater and also helped with positioning
        of my footer and headers. I also learnt how to do media query which made my website responsive for all 
        devices
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 4</h2>
    <p>In week 4 i Learnt abit more responsive image by using '%' which made it way easier as compared to 
        writing down @media and the px size. Other than that i was also introduced to github where i can edit my
        files and update it so that my teacher can see my wokr
    </p>

    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 5</h2>
    <p>In week 5 i was introduced to java. Java was so interesting yet confusing. However lucky for me it is 
        quite similar to C# which i had experience in and i was also quite good at C#. It took me awhile but i
        manage to get a hold of it.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 6</h2>
    <p>In week 6 I did a recap on javascript. I was quite confident as i already got used to it from the experience
        through linkedIN course which actually benefitted alot. im actually quite happy that the school provided
        me with that course because i think without it would probably be hard to understand.
    </p>

    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 7</h2>
    <p>In week 7 I learnt some things to make my website extremely interactable by using buttons and also some
        blurs when hover and many different type of effects. I also added some of the effects into my assignment
        to make it look better and interactable. I also improved my skills on editing the website using the "inspect"
        function
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 8</h2>
    <p>In week 8 I learnt an easier way to do Javascript which is jquery. I was actually quite stunned because 
        it would have been way easier if i was able to use this in my assignement but nevertheless, i still 
        learned it although the concept is highly similar to Javascript. Another thing i learned is API which is
        the hardest thing to understand in my opinion. I read it multiple times and its still hard to actually
        understand and apply.
    </p>
    <hr>
    <h2 style = "text-align: center;">Week 9</h2>
    <p>In week 9 I learnt how to use bootstrap, which is pretty much a shortcut to making websites. All i did was 
        copy paste some script links and cards and suddenly it all just turned out the way i wanted to. I can see
        why this was not allowed in the assignment as it does not really test our html skills although it does help 
        save time when making an actual website
